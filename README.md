# Range Component - MCA Spain
> By Sergio Cerdá Hervás

Hi, I'm Sergio! Welcome to my solution to the technical test on MCA Spain. 

As requested at the briefing of the exercise, this project was made up without any CLI, so my first steps on it were to create the repository on github, start the npm project using `npm init` and install all the necessary next and react dependencies.

There is a live preview of the project at https://mca-range-solution.vercel.app/, but you can check it on localhost if needed.

To do that, first you will need to install all these dependencies with the install command:

```
npm install
```

Then, run the development server with:

```
npm run dev
```

As required, the project will run on http://localhost:8080/, where I take the freedom to create a minimum homepage and a header, linking to both exercises:

- http://localhost:8080/exercise1
- http://localhost:8080/exercise2


Also, there are some suite tests created with jest and react testing library, which you can run with the command:

```
npm run test
```
